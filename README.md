# CUDA Programming

This repository is my personal study notes on CUDA programming. I will be using the book "Professonial CUDA C Programming" by John Cheng, Max Grossman, and Ty McKercher as the main reference. I will also be using the book "CUDA by Example" by Jason Sanders and Edward Kandrot as a secondary reference.
