# Introduction

## What is in this chapter?
1. Understanding herterogeneous computer architecture
2. Recognzing the parallelism shift of parallel computing
3. Grasping the basic elements of GPU programming
4. Knowing the differences between CPU and GPU programming

The high-performance computing (HPC) is to use multiple processors to solve complex computational problems with high throughput and efficiency. It is not only a computing architecture but also a set of elements, including hardware systems, software tools, programming platforms, and parallel programming paradigms
